## Welcome to Sahil Tikale's Web page

### Research Interest
I am interested in cloud scale systems with focus on bare-metal clouds. My research focus is to understand the at-scale issues pertaining to hardware multiplexing in a multi-cloud environment. Currently, I am involved in building a system that allows elastic scaling of cloud and non-cloud infrastructure akin to on demand scaling of applications in a virtualization based cloud.
